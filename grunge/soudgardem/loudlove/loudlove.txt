Loud Like Love
Placebo

Love on an atom
Love on a cloud
To see the birth of all that isn't now
Can you imagine a love that is so proud?
It never has to question why or how
Total abandon the love in my dreams
When I wake up I'm soaking in my sheets

Breathe
Breathe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe

For all of our youth
We have craved them
Their beauty and their truth

Breathe
Believe
Breathe
Believe
Believe

That we are loud like

Love on an atom
Love on a cloud
To see the birth of all that isn't now
Can you imagine a love that is so proud?
It never has to question why or how

For all of our youth
We have craved them
Their beauty and their truth
So we name them
And somehow they pull us through
We have craved them
For all of our youth

Breathe
Believe

We are loud like love
We are loud like love
We are loud like love
