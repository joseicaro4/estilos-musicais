Ride
Lana Del Rey

Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singin' blues has been gettin' old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (don't break me down)
I been travelin' too long (I been travelin' too long)
I been tryin' too hard (I been tryin' too hard)
With one pretty song (with one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dyin' young and playin' hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk till dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light till dark

Don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feelin' like I'm fuckin' crazy
I'm tired of drivin' till I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride
